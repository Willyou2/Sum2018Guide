\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3}{\ignorespaces We can understand the holes as just being occupied simultaneously by equal and opposite charges. So, combining the positive charges with the uniform density, we have a full circle and combining the negative charges of the same density, we have 2 negatively charged circles.}}{8}}

\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {4}{\ignorespaces This image represents the idea of superposition. As you can see, the electric field at any point can be represented by the sum of the electric field of every individual electric field at that point (in this case, the sum of electric fields due to individual charges).}}{9}}

\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {6}{\ignorespaces The image is a graphical representation of this method of integrating along an infinite plane.

\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {7}{\ignorespaces The image is a little blurry, but it represents the box that we constructed around our plate. The box is our surface.
